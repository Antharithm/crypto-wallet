FULL STARTUP
anvil
npm run dev
make deploy
Once the ERC20 mock tokens are deployed, copy those addresses and paste them into the blockchain.json file
To add more ERC20 tokens, add them to the Token.s.sol and blockchain.json files

OR deploy mocktokens on a testnet, get those token addresses and swap the private key in the Makefile with metamask private key

CHECK COMMANDS
cast balance --erc20 0x0_ADDRESS_OF_THE_ERC20_TOKEN 0x0_ADDRESS_OF_TO_ADDRESS (after sending a tx)

OTHER COMMANDS
soldeer install @openzeppelin-contracts~5.0.2
forge soldeer install @openzeppelin-contracts~5.0.2

FUTURE UPGRADES
- Dropdown to switch networks (testnet, mainnet, etc) update the configuration file to implement a Dropdown
- Add a built in way to trade on uniswap
- Package it as a mobile app or chrome extention (avoid private key locally)
